A first iteration of a music streaming app.

A simple Python Flask application with static files and templates.

Install flask using pip, prefereably in a virtual env.

```sh
> pip install flask
```


To run type ```run_musicplayer.bat```   (or ./run_musicplayer.sh on Mac)
```sh
> cd flask_demo
> set FLASK_APP=musicplayer
> set FLASK_ENV=development
> flask run
```

### Bootstrap

This app uses the Bootstrap libraries for the front-end. See

## The Flask Tutorial

If you want to learn how to build your own web sites and web apps using Flask, follow the tutorial here -

<https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/>

### Important

The tutorial instructions install the tutorial application in a virtual environment as a module called **flaskr**, so you must first create a virtual environment. 

If you get errors when following the install instructions you might need to install wheel in your virtual env first.

```sh
pip install wheel
```
